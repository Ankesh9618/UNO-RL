# Numerical computing library (often a dependency for torch and used for array operations)
numpy

# Plotting library used in train.py for visualizing training progress
matplotlib

# --- Notes ---
# - Python's standard libraries (random, collections, os, sys, copy) are not listed here.
# - It's highly recommended to pin specific versions for reproducibility.
#   After installing these packages in your virtual environment, run:
#   pip freeze > requirements.txt
#   This will update the file with the exact versions you have installed (e.g., torch==2.0.1).
# - Depending on your system and how you install PyTorch (e.g., with CUDA support),
#   the installation command might be more specific. Refer to the official PyTorch website:
