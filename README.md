# UNO-RL

Welcome to the UNO-RL project! This repository contains a reinforcement learning (RL) based AI designed to play the card game UNO. The goal of this project is to explore the application of RL techniques to a popular card game and to create an AI that can play UNO at a competitive level.

## Project Overview

This project is implemented in Python and leverages various libraries and frameworks to build and train the RL model. The main components of this project include:

- **Environment**: A simulation of the UNO game where the RL agent can interact and learn.
- **Agent**: The reinforcement learning agent that uses various RL algorithms to learn how to play UNO.
- **Training**: Scripts and configurations to train the RL agent using the UNO environment.
- **Evaluation**: Tools to evaluate the performance of the trained RL agent against human players or other AI agents.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow the steps below:

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Ankesh9618/UNO-RL.git
    cd UNO-RL
    ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Run the training script**:
    ```bash
    python train.py
    ```

4. **Evaluate the trained model**:
    ```bash
    python evaluate.py
    ```
